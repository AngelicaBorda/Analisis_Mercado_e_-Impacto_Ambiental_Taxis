They DOUBLED the price of my ride the day of the event and CHARGED MY CARD OVER $1000 without my permission. I am currently working to get $390 back still.<br />I do not know if they changed management, but I experienced the most unprofessional car service booking of my life. I booked a sprinter van for 14 ppl for the night of NYE. After booking online I called to ensure the booking was accurate and received by all parties. The day of my booking, I received a notification that the price for my trip leaving had doubled!! Their reasoning was because the driver I had decided to raise his price due the holiday. I’m not sure what that has to do with me as a customer?? Dial 7 should have dealt with the driver internally rather than punishing a customer the day of their event! I actually ended up having to negotiate the driver down through the phone operator (yes this is crazy but I had no other choice at the time). <br /><br />After agreeing to pay the driver a higher rate, a few hours later, I see a charge on my card for $648!!! Like what! Keep in mind the total cost of my trip was about $880 so where does that number even come from?<br /><br />I called to complain 3 times. The first time, the operate said it was to check my funds and would be refunded within the hour. When it was not refunded, I called again and an extremely rude and uninformed man told me that the previous operator gave me the wrong information (???) and I would not receive my money back until after I paid for the first trip. I hung up out of frustration and called back later for more clarity. Upon calling a 3rd time, I notice that my account was charged again for $390. I nearly had a heart attack. I haven’t been that mad in a LONG time. <br /><br />I called again and threatened to call my bank and report fraud and I accused them of being scammers. The operate let me know the only way to refund me would be to cancel my trip. When I asked if she could rebook I heard the same rude male operators voice in the background demanding the woman on the phone to hang up on me and cancel my trip entirely without rebooking. <br /><br />Long story short, my trip was canceled. I received a refund a few hours later for the $648 and I’m still waiting on the $390. I called them today and will report fraud if it is not deposited within the next couple hours. <br /><br />Ultimately, it was a blessing they canceled because I definitely did not want to support them after all they went through. We were actually able to fit our group of 14 into two large Ubers which we scheduled a few hours earlier. The price stays the same if you schedule in advance. <br /><br />Do not ruin your plans trying to book with this company they are extremely rude and unprofessional and irresponsible with credit cards. I still can’t believe they charged my card like that. Feeling financially violated. I never leave reviews, but refuse to accept that.
